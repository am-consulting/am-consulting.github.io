Ministry of Finance (data retrieved from CEIC) and National Audit Office (NAO) (data obtained from NAO audit report) Latest actual data: 2015. Headline data (eg., revenue and expenditure) is updated to 2015 number, but actual data of some detailed componets (e.g. interest payment) is not available for 2015 Notes: Fiscal Balance: Data differ from official figures released by China?s Ministry of Finance mainly because of a difference in treatment of net contributions to the other accounts (e.g. Budget Stabilization Fund). General Government Debt: Data differ from official figures released by China?s Ministry of Finance because IMF numbers include, from 2010 onward, the stock of local government debt outstanding as reported in the June 2011 National Audit Office Report. For subsequent years, we have followed the amortization schedule outlined in the same report. Fiscal assumptions: The pace of fiscal consolidation is likely to be more gradual, reflecting reforms to strengthen social safety nets and the social security system announced as part of the Third Plenum reform agenda.
